                <p>
                    This Saturday from the O2 Arena in London, David Haye returns to the ring with the second "Haye Day" event of 2016, following his successful comeback fight in January, as he faces the undefeated, untested, unknown, likely unprepared cobra, Arnold Gjergjaj.
                    Here's a look at this fight, which is, you know... it is what it is, as they say.
                    <br>
                </p>

                <h3>David Haye:</h3>
                <p>
                    Thoughts: It's worth noting that Haye's last five fights go back to 2010, and his last 10 go back to 2007. "The Hayemaker" took three and a half years off after a win over Dereck Chisora in 2012 and a shoulder surgery in 2013, which scuppered a fight
                    with Tyson Fury. Looking back, that could've been hugely interesting, even more so than we thought at the time, but it didn't happen. Boxing-wise, Haye was significantly bulkier and heavier in January, weighing in at 227Â¼ pounds, well
                    above the 210 he weighed in to face Dereck Chisora, Wladimir Klitschko, and Audley Harrison in his previous three bouts. He weighed 222 when he beat John Ruiz in 2010, his previous career-high weight. Before, he felt that sacrificing
                    bulk helped him maintain his speed, which was always his real advantage at heavyweight. Now, he's older, so weight isn't as easy to cut, and he also may feel that, in fact, bulk is better for him now, at least in fights where his speed
                    is so significantly greater than his opponent's that he might as well have more muscle.

                </p>
                <h3>Arnold Gjerjaj</h3>
                <p>
                    "Who the hell is Arnold Gjergjaj?" That was what everyone thought as soon as Haye's opponent announcement was leaked, and if they didn't think it then, they thought it when it was officially announced the next day. Gjergjaj is a big bodied fighter originally
                    from Gjakova, Kosovo, now residing in Pratteln, Swizterland, where he's fought 28 of his 29 pro fights, with one in Hungary back in 2011. He is an unproven fringe contender, a fighter whose best wins have come against Denis Bakhtov
                    and ... well, Denis Bakhtov was the most familiar name he's fought to date. Really, the only familiar name. This is, of course, a huge opportunity for Gjergjaj. A win for him would not really send shockwaves through boxing (gasp),
                    but would likely net vhim a world title fight just based on beating someone with a big name.The relative disrespect shown to Gjergjaj is one of those unfortunate things in boxing; it's not Gjergjaj's fault that this fight isn't very
                    compelling and feels the way it does going in. He's just a guy who got a call and jumped at a big chance to do something he's worked hard to do. Hopefully the moment doesn't take him the way it did de Mori in January. As long as he
                    gives the effort, that's really all anyone can ask.
